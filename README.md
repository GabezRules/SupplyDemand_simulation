# SupplyDemand_simulation
Inspired by this video -> https://youtu.be/PNtKXWNKGN8

The project aims to simulate the behavior of sellers and buyers in a simple market. 
Before you open the file, I highly recommend you to watch the video linked above to understand the operation and principles of simulation.

# How to use market_simulation file

Complete the variables with paths to the files where you want to save the data:
  * PATH_TO_SAVE_BUYERS 
  * PATH_TO_SAVE_SELLERS 

Variables for you to play with:
  * NUM_DAYS - number of simulated days 
  * NUM_SELLERS - total amount of sellers
  * NUM_BUYERS - total amount of buyers
  
Tip: how the market will behave with diffrences between sellers and buyers?
